## üìö Study/Work Assistant Testing

### Test 1: Document Summarization

**Text Input Method:**
```
Summarize this: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that work and react like humans. Some of the activities computers with artificial intelligence are designed for include speech recognition, learning, planning, and problem-solving. AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis. However, one criticism of AI has been its failure to produce systems that are genuinely intelligent, rather than systems that are merely good at performing specific tasks.
